*Important changes with respect to the 1.0 version:
- A bug in the copy constructor of GeomParameter was removed
- The running canvas option is back non-MPI enebaled versions: you can observe running simulations
- XML examples were added

	Added forgotten <<operator for int

	Reports added to nodes. However they seem not to work correct.

2012-06-07  David Sichau  <mail@sichau.eu>

	It now runs but not sure if it does any meaningfull yet.

	Compiling version  of Wilson Example.

	Compilation and linking of all files.

	Test compile and pass.

	removed files available in DynamicLib

	Make MPILib dependent on the rest to increase reuse.

	Small interface changes

	Added WilsonCowanAlgorithm

2012-06-06  David Sichau  <mail@sichau.eu>

	Added Wextra code warnings and removed them.

	removed all warnings.

	Added warnings flags

	Cleaned up include dirs.

	Merge branch 'mpi_complete_new' into templateNode
	Conflicts:
		libs/MPILib/include/MPINetwork.hpp
		libs/MPILib/include/MPINode.hpp
		libs/MPILib/src/MPINetwork.cpp
		libs/MPILib/src/MPINode.cpp
		libs/MPILib/test/MPINode_test.cpp

	Changed local Nodes and NodeDistribution to pointers.

	Template Argument for the node Distribution.

2012-06-05  David Sichau  <mail@sichau.eu>

	doc update

	doc update.

	Working templates with algorithm interface as template.

	First working template version.

	Added getCurrentRate and getCurrentTime to the algorithm interface.

	Renamed EmptyAlgorithm to Sleep10secAlgorithm

	Measure the runtime of the Evolve method and take the maximum of all processors.

	Added test for Time.hpp

	Added platform independent Time handling.

2012-06-04  David Sichau  <mail@sichau.eu>

	Added a algorithm interface.

	Test for MPINode added.

	improved test.

	cleaned test.

	Doc update, include variables in the headers.

	doc update and adding variables in the header.

	private inheritance from boost::noncopyable

	Make reference const to avoid misuse.

	Local "communication" also works.

	A node now also stores a reference to the local nodes.

	for this case working version of send and recv.

2012-06-01  David Sichau  <mail@sichau.eu>

	Deaktivated mem test as they do not work at the moment.

	Nicer messages. Spring cleaning of the cmake code.

	doc added.

	Easier adding of test in cmake file. Removed the example test as now there exist enough other tests.

	Added test for ParallelException

	Added test for the exception. Make sure that the test are executed with two processors.

	Test for CircularDistribution added.

	Removed distibution related code in MPINode and replaced it with the NodeDistribution from MPINetwork.

	refractored the code related to the NodeDistribution to own class. New ways to add different types of Distribution can be added via the NodeDistributionInterface.

2012-05-31  David Sichau  <mail@sichau.eu>

	Ignore more eclipse stuff

	Test for MPINetwork added.

	removed wrong assert

	Memory test now also with mpi

	simplified cmake files removed not needed dependencies.

	test which compiles and need mpirun. However Cmake at the moment does not execute the test with mpirun.

	Added testing with CTest and Boost Test Framework. Also added memory tests with valgrind.

	Changed CMake to build with ENABLE_MPI only the mpi library.

	Removed forgotten to remove Macro

2012-05-30  David Sichau  <mail@sichau.eu>

	First implementation of the send and recv operations.

	Changed the error handling for MPINetwork to exceptions.

	added namespace to convenience macros.

	Renamed include guards to make sure that they have the same convention.

	 - Moved files to directories  - Added Namespace for all classes

	Catch exceptions thrown.

	Change exceptions - Nicer output of error message. - Switched from boost::exception to std::exception, as no coping of exceptions is needed (no shared memory parallelisation)

	Now ParallelExecution works.

	Added exception class for parallel execution failures.

	Added Exception, use one from libpipe released with the MIT Licence.

2012-05-29  David Sichau  <mail@sichau.eu>

	Stub methods for recieving and sending data added.

	Added the node state.

	changed const correctness

	Added information about the current processor and the number of processors to the Node.

	added connection of nodes. Each node stores its precursors and successors to allow easier data collection from them.

	Extracted common types in own header file

	Doxygen update

	Synchronization of the maxNodeId between the networks. This allows the generation of nodes without assigning numbers to the nodes.

2012-05-25  David Sichau  <mail@sichau.eu>

	automatic find of mpi under Linux with cmake

	docs

	Node distribution is working.

	added linking against boost mpi

	added forgetten include directories

	First MPINetwork interface

	Start from scratch. Simple example to make sure cmake works.

2012-05-24  David Sichau  <mail@sichau.eu>

	Typo removed

	Added cmake files for new MPILib

	ignore the DS_ files of Mac OS X

	Include the mpi executable to cmake and use cmake to link the needed boost libraries. However at the moment the compiler settings need to be done with setting an environment variable. This need to be changed in the future.

2012-05-23  David Sichau  <mail@sichau.eu>

	Merge branch 'master' into clang

	added eclipse folder to gitignore

	clang fixes to get rid of the "error: use of undeclared identifier" messages

	added gitignore file, at the moment only to avoid the accidental commitment of the build folder

	initial commit
