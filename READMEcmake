Dependencies:

gsl
root (can be found at http://root.cern.ch) preferable the latest Version 
     especially for MacOS 10.6 (tested with Development Release 5.25)
ImageMagick
gtkmm
fftw
swig for python integration
python 2.6 

The provided cmake build environment is yet only able to generate makefiles 
for MacOS up 10.4 to 10.6  and linux, makefiles for Eclipse and a Xcode project 
files for MacOSX 10.4 to 10.6. Using Xcode on 10.6 makes it mandatory to manually
change the Architectures setting in build info dialog to "64-Bit Intel" if you 
are using MacPorts (Fink not tested yet)
The project files generated for MS-VS are not fully developed by now. 

To configure make directory called somethin like <build>
type: cmake .. (cmake -G Xcode .. for Xcode proj.file)
by typing ccmake .. you can invoke an interactive version.
Within ccmake simply follow the instructions on the screen

Thanks to Lorenz M"osenlechner for helping us to make the
transition to cmake
