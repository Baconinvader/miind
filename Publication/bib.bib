The evolution in time of the population density is determined by a partial differential equation (PDE). Most of the algorithms proposed to solve this PDE have used finite difference schemes. Here, I use the method of characteristics to reduce the PDE to a set of ordinary differential equations, which are easy to solve. The method is applied to leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons and produces an algorithm that is efficient and yields a stable and manifestly nonnegative density. Contrary to algorithms based directly on finite difference schemes, this algorithm is insensitive to large density gradients, which may occur during evolution of the density.}},

These techniques are sometimes defined as the interaction of neuronal dynamics and a Poisson point process. In earlier work I showed that one can transform away neuronal dynamics, which leaves only the problem of solving the master equation for the Poisson point process. Previously, I used a numerical solution for the master equation. In this work, I will present an analytic solution, which is based on a formal solution by Sirovich (2003). I will show that using this solution for solving the population density equation results in a much faster and manifestly stable algorithm.}},

Various methods such as the simulation method, the eigenfunction expansion, numerical integration, the variational method, and the matrix continued-fraction method are discussed. This is the first time that this last method, which is very effective in dealing with simple Fokker-Planck equations having two variables, appears in a textbook. The methods of solution are applied to the statistics of a simple laser model and to Brownian motion in potentials. It is shown that the solution of the equation for Brownian motion in a variety of potentials can be expressed in terms suitable for evaluation on a computer. A supplement is included, containing a short review of new material together with some recent references. The book should be very useful to graduate students in physics, chemical physics, and electrical engineering, and also to research workers in these fields.}},

In their presentation cortical dynamics is formulated in terms of interacting populations of neurons, a perspective that is in part motivated by modern cortical imaging. The approach may be regarded as the application of statistical mechanics to neuronal populations, and the simplest exemplar bears a kinship to the Boltzmann equation of kinetic theory. The disarming simplicity of this linear equation hides the complex behaviour it produces. A purpose of this paper is to investigate and reveal its intricacies by treating a series of solvable special cases. In particular we will focus on issues that relate to the spectral analysis of the underlying operators. A fairly thorough treatment is presented for a simple, but still useful example, that has important consequences for more general situations.}},
