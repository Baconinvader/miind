How to generate the miind debian package
1.05 is used as the example version number here, increment as appropriate.

In working directory: 
git clone <miind git repo link> miind-1.05
cd miind-1.05
rm -r .git
cd ..
tar -cvzf miind-1.05.tar.gz miind-1.05
cd miind-1.05
dh_make -f ../miind-1.05.tar.gz
(When prompted) answer i and y
cp package/control debian/
cp package/miind.links debian/
cp package/rules debian/
dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc --source-option=--include-binaries
cd ..

Working directory contains miind_1.05-1_all.deb which can be installed using

sudo apt install ./miind_1.05-1_all.deb

This package has MPI, OPENMP and CUDA enabled. ROOT is disabled. To change this, edit the dh_auto_configure line in rules and set the required CMAKE flags. 

Note also that by default, miindio.py sets MPI, OPENMP and CUDA to enabled and ROOT to disabled - can be changed with the 'settings' command.
