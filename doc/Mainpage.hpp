\section sec_intro Introduction
MIIND provides a simulation framework for neural simulations. It focusses on population level
descriptions of neural dynamics, i.e. it does not provide a siumulator for individual neurons,
but models populations directly. It provides support for simple neural mass models, but
focusses strongly on so-called population density techniques.

To get a feeling for the simulator and its capabilities,
we encourage you to read the following <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608008001457">paper</a> 
(an open access <a href="http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/5235/">preprint</a> version is also available).

Currently, part of the developent is funded by the <a href="http://www.humanbrainproject.eu/">Human Brain Project</a>.  
A new official release date will be 1 October 2014. The new release will contain many new algorithms, including
other populations than leaky-integrate-and-fire ones. The documentation will be revamped.
