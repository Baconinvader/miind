## The Barcelona tutorial (13/07/2019)
On Monday 8 July 2017 documentation for the MIIND tutorial at CNS2019 in Barcelona will appear here. It is strongly recommended you bring a laptop, we will bring virtual machines
with MIIND preinstalled, so if you can run Virtual Box or similar, you will be able to participate. If you run Ubuntu, a Debbian package will be made available.

## MIIND: a population level simulator.
