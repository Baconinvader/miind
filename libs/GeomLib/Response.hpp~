/*! \fn ResponseFunction
    \brief A test class.

    Gain curve (or transfer function; response function) for LIF neurons and Gaussian white noise input. In ResponseParameter you provide mean, variance
    and neuron parameters. A population firing rate is returned. This function provides corrections on the well known result for DC input.
