    abstract = {{An outstanding problem in computational neuroscience is how to use population density function (PDF) methods to model neural networks with realistic synaptic kinetics in a computationally efficient manner. We explore an application of two-dimensional (2-D) PDF methods to simulating electrical activity in networks of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons. We formulate a pair of coupled partial differentialintegral equations describing the evolution of PDFs for neurons in non-refractory and refractory pools. The population firing rate is given by the total flux of probability across the threshold voltage. We use an operator-splitting method to reduce computation time. We report on speed and accuracy of PDF results and compare them to those from direct, MonteCarlo simulations. We compute temporal frequency response functions for the transduction from the rate of postsynaptic input to population firing rate, and examine its dependence on background synaptic input rate. The behaviors in the1-D and 2-D casescorresponding to instantaneous and non-instantaneous synaptic kinetics, respectivelydiffer markedly from those for a somewhat different transduction: from <i>injected current input</i> to population firing rate output (Brunel et al. 2001; Fourcaud \&amp; Brunel 2002). We extend our method by adding inhibitory input, consider a 3-D to 2-D dimension reduction method, demonstrate its limitations, and suggest directions for future study.}},

    abstract = {{A population density description of large populations of neurons has generated considerable interest recently. The evolution in time of the population density is determined by a partial differential equation (PDE). Most of the algorithms proposed to solve this PDE have used finite difference schemes. Here, I use the method of characteristics to reduce the PDE to a set of ordinary differential equations, which are easy to solve. The method is applied to leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons and produces an algorithm that is efficient and yields a stable and manifestly nonnegative density. Contrary to algorithms based directly on finite difference schemes, this algorithm is insensitive to large density gradients, which may occur during evolution of the density.}},

@article{dekamps2008,
    abstract = {{MIIND (Multiple Interacting Instantiations of Neural Dynamics) is a highly modular multi-level C++ framework, that aims to shorten the development time for models in Cognitive Neuroscience (CNS). It offers reusable code modules (libraries of classes and functions) aimed at solving problems that occur repeatedly in modelling, but tries not to impose a specific modelling philosophy or methodology. At the lowest level, it offers support for the implementation of sparse networks. For example, the library SparseImplementationLib supports sparse random networks and the library LayerMappingLib can be used for sparse regular networks of filter-like operators. The library DynamicLib, which builds on top of the library SparseImplementationLib, offers a generic framework for simulating network processes. Presently, several specific network process implementations are provided in MIIND: the Wilson–Cowan and Ornstein–Uhlenbeck type, and population density techniques for leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons driven by Poisson input. A design principle of MIIND is to support detailing: the refinement of an originally simple model into a form where more biological detail is included. Another design principle is extensibility: the reuse of an existing model in a larger, more extended one. One of the main uses of MIIND so far has been the instantiation of neural models of visual attention. Recently, we have added a library for implementing biologically-inspired models of artificial vision, such as HMAX and recent successors. In the long run we hope to be able to apply suitably adapted neuronal mechanisms of attention to these artificial models.}},

Depending on the issues addressed and the degree of realism incorporated in the simulated neurons, a wide range of different population dynamics formulations can be appropriate. Here we present a common mathematical structure that these various formulations share and that implies dynamical behaviors that they have in common. This underlying structure serves as a guide toward efficient means of simulation. As an example, we derive the general population firing-rate frequency-response and show how it may be used effectively to address a broad range of interacting-population response and stability problems. A few specific cases will be worked out. A summary of this work appears at the end, before the appendix.}},

    abstract = {{ A simple neuronal model is assumed in which, after a refractory period, excitatory and inhibitory exponentially decaying inputs of constant size occur at random intervals and sum until a threshold is reached. The distribution of time intervals between successive neuronal firings (interresponse time histogram), the firing rate as a function of input frequency, the variability in the time course of depolarization from trial to trial, and the strength-duration curve are derived for this model. The predictions are compared with data from the literature and good qualitative agreement is found. All parameters are experimentally measurable and a direct test of the theory is possible with present techniques. The assumptions of the model are relaxed and the effects of such experimentally found phenomena as relative refractory and supernormal periods, adaptation, potentiation, and rhythmic slow potentials are discussed. Implications for gross behavior studies are considered briefly. }},

                Coupled nonlinear differential equations are derived for the dynamics of spatially localized populations containing both excitatory and inhibitory model neurons. Phase plane methods and numerical solutions are then used to investigate population responses to various types of stimuli. The results obtained show simple and multiple hysteresis phenomena and limit cycle activity. The latter is particularly interesting since the frequency of the limit cycle oscillation is found to be a monotonic function of stimulus intensity. Finally, it is proved that the existence of limit cycle dynamics in response to one class of stimuli implies the existence of multiple stable states and hysteresis in response to a different class of stimuli. The relation between these findings and a number of experiments is discussed.
